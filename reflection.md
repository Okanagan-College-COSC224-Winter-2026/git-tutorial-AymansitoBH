# Git Tutorial Reflection

## What I learned
- What Git is and why version control is important
- The difference between Git and GitHub
- How repositories, branches, and pull requests work
- How commits and pushes track project history

## What I am still confused about
- When to use forks vs branches in real projects
- How CI checks are configured in team repositories

## What I liked
- The GitHub flow explanation
- Seeing how pull requests are used in real team workflows
